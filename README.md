# Implementation of Extended Kalman Filter on Matlab Simulink with Ros2 for localization using IMU & Encoder scan for Independent drive and independent Steer robot

This Code uses uses data encoder and IMU data gathered from Nvidia Isaac sim and published to ROS2. .USD file & ROS2 Bridge code are not available to be due to copyright.

To Run Code
Initialize variableDeclare.m
Run Sensor_fusion_4.slx

Note, you need to have ROS2 Humble, publishing in /IMU, /Joint_States and /Joint_command
Also Simulink,  Systems Control Toolbox are needed
